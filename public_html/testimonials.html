<h1>Little Rising Stars is....</h1>
<p>Read what some of our parents think about the school</p>

<p class="flip1">Enriching and warm....</p>
<div class="panel1">
<p>We have been part of Little Rising Stars since it first opened. It has been such an enriching and warm experience for all three of my kids.</p>
<p>The teachers at Little Rising Stars are caring, patient and considerate. They do a great job of helping each child practice and build on the skills they need for kindergarten and beyond.</p>
<p>We will always have such fond memories of this wonderful school.

<p class="flip2">Amazing....</p>
<div class="panel2">
<p>Little Rising Stars is a perfect fit for my son . The staff is amazing and they treat all the kids with the upmost respect. He is excited every morning for school because it's a fun and safe atmosphere.</p>
<p>I am truly thankful for the time spent teaching the children because I know they are preparing each child for their early kindergarten years.</p>

<p class="flip3">Engaging....</p>
<div class="panel3">
<p>I cannot express how satisfied we are with Little Rising Stars. My daughter has been enrolled here for the last 3 years. The teachers she has had each year are engaging and well trained. The center is very clean and they take the care and safety of our child very serious.</p> 
<p>My daughter truly enjoys going to "play school" every day and she surprises us on a regular basis on what she has learned at Little Rising Stars.</p> 
<p>We recently received her assessments and were extremely pleased with the results. Our daughter will go into kindergarten very prepared. I would not hesitate to recommend this center to anyone looking for an excellent child care facility.</p>

<p class="flip4">A fantastic child care facility.....</p>
<div class="panel4">
<p>Little Rising Stars is a fantastic child care facility! Our little girl attended for about 8 months. The staff is like family.</p>
<p>The teachers take excellent care of the children. LRS does arts & crafts with the children and they read stories. LRS has age appropriate playscapes for the children to have some outside fun.</p>
<p>LRS also serves a balanced diet that includes breakfast, lunch & snacks with your tuition! We only removed our daughter because child care was no longer necessary. We would strongly recommend LRS to any one looking for a quality child care facility.</p>
